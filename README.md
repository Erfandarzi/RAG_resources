# RAG Resources

Starter code for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) projects and tools. This repository provides examples and best practice guidelines for building RAG systems. Our goal is to build a comprehensive set of tools and examples that leverage recent advances in natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning.

## Target Audience

Our target audience includes data scientists, machine learning engineers, and developers with varying levels of NLP and information retrieval knowledge. The utilities and examples provided are intended to be solution accelerators for real-world RAG problems.

## Getting Started

To get started, navigate to the [Setup Guide](link_to_your_setup_guide.md), which lists instructions on how to setup the compute environment and dependencies needed to run the notebooks in this repo.

For the AI News Hound project, you can start with this Jupyter notebook:
