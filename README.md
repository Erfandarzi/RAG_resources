# üöÄ RAG Resources

Starter code for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) projects and tools. This repository provides examples and best practice guidelines for building RAG systems. Our goal is to build a comprehensive set of tools and examples that leverage recent advances in natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning.
